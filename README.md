Empirical software engineering research aims to generate prescriptive knowledge that can help software engineers improve their work and overcome their challenges, but deriving these insights from real-world problems can be challenging. We promote design science as an effective way to produce and communicate prescriptive knowledge while we propose using a visual abstract template to communicate design science contributions and highlight the main problem/solution constructs of this area of research, as well as to present the validity aspects of design knowledge. 

We have posted a template of this visual abstract, and we welcome comments as well as examples of how this abstract can be applied to your research!

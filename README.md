# VASE: Visual Abstracts for Software Engineering

Empirical software engineering research aims to generate prescriptive knowledge that can help software engineers improve their work and overcome their challenges, but deriving these insights from real-world problems can be challenging. We promote design science as an effective way to produce and communicate prescriptive knowledg while we propose using a visual abstract template to communicate design science contributions and highlight the main problem/solution constructs of this area of research, as well as to present the validity aspects of design knowledge. 

We have posted a template of this visual abstract, and we welcome comments as well as examples of how this abstract can be applied to your research!
